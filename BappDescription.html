<p>Repeater Strike is an AI-powered tool that helps uncover IDOR and other vulnerabilities by analyzing your Repeater requests. It automatically generates targeted regular expressions based on the requests and responses you're testing. Once a vulnerability is detected, these regexes are applied to your proxy history to rapidly identify similar issues across your entire traffic, helping you scale your findings and save time.</p>
