<p>Repeater Strike is an AI-powered tool designed to uncover IDOR and other vulnerabilities through the analysis of your Repeater requests. By automatically generating targeted regular expressions based on tested requests and responses, it aids in detecting vulnerabilities. Once a potential vulnerability is identified, these regular expressions are applied to your proxy history, allowing for quick identification of similar issues across your entire traffic. This accelerates the discovery process and can significantly save time.</p>
